Currently all variables are now set through Global variables. This allows ease of setting the script up on multiple characters with different Guilds as well as removing the need to edit the script file directly. All of the 
vairables below can be set as globals.

##Specific Spell Info
##Cage Of Light	-	Must have the Time & Moon Plugin written by pbombard, and make sure you have
##					Log Game Events checked in the options for that plugin.
##Benediction	-	Make sure you set the buff.immortal variable
##Rutilor's Edge	-	Currently does not support offhand use.
##Bond Armaments	-	Currently does not support offhand use.
##Quicken the Earth - Should work
##SET THE FOLLOWING VARIABLES IN YOUR GLOBALS
##
##buff.trace	-	Set to YES if you are a Paladin with the Glyph of Mana ability, and you wish to use it in this script.
##					set to NO if you don't want to use it
##buff.spells	-	These are the spells you wish to cast in array form.  The spells must be listed to correspond with the variables for the spells
##					and this is usually the shortened version of the spell name.  ie.  COUR = Courage, AS = Anti Stun,  so the variable would be
##					COUR|AS
##buff.prep		-	This is the amount of mana you want to prep the corresponding spell to.  This is also in array form.  Working with the
##					above example where buff.spell is COUR|AS  buff.prep 12|10  would prepare courage at 12, and anti stun at 10
##buff.charge.total	-	This is the amount you're going to charge a cambrinth item to.  Array format
##buff.charge.total2 -  This is the ammount you're going to change a second cambrinth item to.  Array format. Set to 0 (zero)if not using
##buff.charge.increment	-	This is how much the script will charge the cambrinth per attempt, up to the max. You can either put seperate amounts for each spell
##							or you can put only 1 amount and that will work for all spells.  Note, if you do it in array format, but put more or less than the number of spells
##							you're using, it will assume you want to use 1 number for all spells, which will be the first one in the array.
##							Ie.  buff.charge.increment 12|5|7 or buff.charge.increment 5
##buff.harness	-	Yes or No, whether to harness or not in script
##buff.harness.total	-	This is the total amount you are going to harness to.  Can be used in addition to or in place of charging cambrinth
##buff.harness.increment	-	This is the amount to harness each time up to buff.harness.total amount.   You can either put seperate amounts for each spell
##							or you can put only 1 amount and that will work for all spells.  Note, if you do it in array format, but put more or less than the number of spells
##							you're using, it will assume you want to use 1 number for all spells, which will be the first one in the array.
##							Ie.  buff.harness.increment 12|5|7 or buff.harness.increment 5
##buff.cambrinth	-	The cambrinth item you are using.  Set to NO to use no cambrinth.
##buff.secondcambrinth	-	The second cambrinth item you are using.  Set to NO to use no cambrinth.
##buff.worn	-	Is the cambrinth items specified above worn
##buff.remove	-	If the cambrinth is set as worn in the above script, do you need to remove it to charge/invoke.  Need roughly 180 ranks or more of
##					arcana to use a worn cambrinth item w/o removing it.
##buff.prep.message	-	The messaging for your character when they begin to prepare a spell.
##buff.continue	-	Set to yes if you want the script to cast all spells before returning to the script that included this one.
##					IE. If you set to no in geniehunter it will cast a single spell, then return to geniehunter.  If set to yes, it will cast
##					every spell in the list before returning to geniehunter.  Only set it to yes if you are certain you have enough mana attunement
##					to handle casting all the spells w/o a break to regain attunement.  Not useful in geniehunter, useful for other scripts.
##buff.manalevel	-	If using Glyph of Mana it will trace at this level or lower
##buff.immortal	-	Use this to set which Immortal to cast Benediction at.
##buff.ba.thrown	-	Set to Yes or No.  Yes only uses the Bond Armaments spell on thrown weapons, No uses it on all
##OM.DELAY	-	The number of seconds the script will wait before renewing OM.  Will not renew if spell ends.  Number.
